    <title>Authentication</title>

    <para>MantisBT supports several authentication techniques out of the box.  In addition, there is work in progress relating to supporting authentication plug-ins.  Once authentication plug-ins are implemented, then authentication against any protocol or repository of user names and passwords can be done without having to touch MantisBT core code.</para>

    <para>Although MantisBT supports multiple authentication techniques, it is important to note that MantisBT doesn't yet support hybrid authentication scenarios.  For example, internal staff authentications against LDAP where customer authentications against MantisBT database.</para>

        <title>Standard Authentication</title>

        <para>Standard, or native, authentication is where MantisBT users are authenticated against user records in the MantisBT database.  The passwords are stored in the database in one of several formats:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>CRYPT - deprecated.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>CRYPT_FULL_SALT - deprecated.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>PLAIN - deprecated.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>MD5 - This is default and recommended approach.  See <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 topic on Wikipedia</ulink> for more details.</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>See $g_login_methods for more details about how to configure MantisBT to use one of the above authentication techniques.</para>

        <title>HTTP_AUTH</title>

        <para>When MantisBT is configured to use basic auth, it automatically detects the logged in user and checks if they are already registered in MantisBT, if not, then a new account is automatically created for the username.</para>

        <title>Open Id</title>

        <para>MantisBT can be configured to accept open ids in addition to other supported login schemes.  The open id support allows new and existng users to log into MantisBT using
        any open id identity provider, this includes but is not limited to the following:
        	<itemizedlist>
        		<listitem>My Open Id</listitem>
        		<listitem>Google</listitem>
        		<listitem>Yahoo</listitem>
        		<listitem>AOL</listitem>
        		<listitem>Verisign</listitem>
        		<listitem>Blogspot</listitem>
        		<listitem>Flickr</listitem>
        		<listitem>WordPress.com</listitem>
        		<listitem>Live Journal</listitem>
        	</itemizedlist>
		</para>

		<para>A user may use more than one Open Id to login into the same MantisBT account as long as these ids have an associated email address that matches the user's account.</para>

		<para>When a user logs in via an Open Id the following steps occur:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>If the open id was used to login into MantisBT before, then the internal user id is retrieved from the open id and the user is logged in.</listitem>
                <listitem>If the open id was associated with a user that was deleted, then the user is re-created (if signup is enabled).</listitem>
                <listitem>If the open id is associated with a disabled user, then user is not allowed to login.</listitem>
                <listitem>If none of the above, then all matching enabled users with the same email address are retrieved.  A user with the same exact user name / email gets higher priority, if not,
                then the user with the highest access level is used.</listitem>
                <listitem>If no matches are found based on the email and signup is enabled, then a new user is created.</listitem>
                <listitem>If none of the above, then the user is redirected back to the login page.</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>The MantisBT Open Id implementation is based on the service provided by <ulink url="https://rpxnow.com">https://rpxnow.com.</ulink>.  Hence, administrators will need
        to register for a free account, add their site and update the MantisBT configuration accordingly.</para>

        <para>Note that the Open Id support requires the PHP curl extension to be available.</para>

        <title>LDAP</title>

        <para>Functionality is provided by using the php-ldap module
            (/usr/lib/php4/ldap.so). An extra login method is defined within
            core/user_API.php inside of function is_password_match $f_username,
            $p_test_password, $p_password ).This has a simple, non encrypted
            (yet) test of the LDAP directory for that user by asking for an
            entry with uid=username and password=test_password, if this exists,
            it is presumed that the user should be granted access.</para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Configuration basics</title>
                <para>the LDIF format that was tested is as follows:
                    <programlisting>dn: uid=tests,
                        dc=test, dc=com, dc=au
                        department: testdep
                        organizationname: Testing Organization
                        cn: Test Smith
                        assignedgroup: users
                        givename: Test
                        sn: Smith
                        mail: tests@example.com.au
                        uid: testsuser
                        Password: password
                        objectclass: testPerson
                    </programlisting>

                    The password may be in clear, taken
                    from the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file, or simply encrypted and
                    added using current LDAP tools.There are some specialized software
                    for replicating passwd to LDAP and inversely (eg.
                    <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/cpu/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/cpu/</ulink>
                    ).
                </para>
            </formalpara>

            <para>Also setup the LDAP parameters explained in the
                <ulink url="manual.configuration.authentication.html">Authentication</ulink>
                section. Don't forget to change your $g_login_method to
                LDAP.
            </para>

            <formalpara>
                <title>Creating new accounts</title><para>There is still a bit of problem when you
                    want to create a new user to MantisBT using LDAP, you must create the
                    LDIF entry to LDAP, and also sign up for a new account, if both of
                    these line up correctly, authentication will proceed.  Email
                    is queried from the LDAP database if the
                    authentication is set to use LDAP instead of the user record in the
                    database entry.</para>
