All the strings translations should use UTF-8 encoding now to allow
for Mantis multilingual operation. Please base your updates on
'strings_<language>.txt' files ONLY.

PLEASE NOTE:
strings_<language>_<encoding>.txt files are temporarily left here
for backward compatibility only, until we can recode them automatically.
Such a translations are considered unmaintained, and could be removed
in the future.

To still use them, please add the appropriate line to
$g_language_choices_arr (e.g. 'bulgarian-1251').
